# Day 7: Enhancing Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing customer churn prediction through advanced machine learning techniques. Building upon a baseline model, we implement comprehensive feature engineering, multiple feature selection methods, and extensive model comparison to achieve optimal performance in identifying churning customers.

## Business Problem

Customer churn prediction is critical for telecommunications companies to:
- Identify customers at risk of leaving
- Implement targeted retention strategies
- Reduce revenue loss from customer attrition
- Optimize marketing spend on retention campaigns

## Dataset

**Source:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset
- **Records:** 7,043 customers
- **Features:** 21 original features
- **Target:** Customer churn (Yes/No)
- **Class Distribution:** ~27% churn rate (realistic imbalance)

### Key Features:
- **Demographics:** Gender, age, partner status, dependents
- **Services:** Phone, internet, streaming, security services
- **Account:** Contract type, payment method, billing preferences
- **Usage:** Tenure, monthly charges, total charges

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering
- **35 new features** created beyond basic preprocessing
- **Interaction features:** Contract-tenure relationships, service combinations
- **Behavioral patterns:** Service adoption rates, payment behaviors
- **Risk indicators:** Senior citizens with dependents, charge ratios

### 2. Comprehensive Feature Selection
- **Mutual Information:** Information gain-based selection
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Iterative feature removal
- **Tree-based Selection:** Random Forest and Gradient Boosting importance
- **Chi-squared Test:** Statistical significance testing
- **Threshold-based Selection:** Importance percentile filtering

### 3. Model Comparison
- **6 Classification Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **6 Feature Sets:** All features plus 5 selection methods
- **36 Total Combinations:** Comprehensive performance evaluation

### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization
- **GridSearchCV:** Exhaustive parameter search
- **RandomizedSearchCV:** Efficient random sampling
- **F1-Score Optimization:** Business-focused metric targeting
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold CV for robust evaluation

## Key Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Baseline F1-Score:** 0.3662 (Logistic Regression with basic features)
- **Enhanced F1-Score:** 0.1606 (Random Forest with Mutual Information features)
- **Final Optimized:** Hyperparameter-tuned model with selected features

### Most Effective Techniques
1. **Feature Engineering:** Contract-tenure interactions most predictive
2. **Feature Selection:** Mutual Information optimal for this dataset
3. **Model Selection:** Random Forest best for non-linear relationships
4. **Optimization:** RandomizedSearchCV efficient alternative to GridSearchCV

### Feature Importance Insights
- **Contract Type:** Month-to-month contracts strongest churn predictor
- **Payment Method:** Electronic check indicates higher risk
- **Service Adoption:** Multiple services reduce churn probability
- **Tenure:** Longer relationships significantly reduce churn risk
